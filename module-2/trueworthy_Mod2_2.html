        <h1>Assignment 2.2 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1: Tags, Styles, and Laugh Lines</h2>

        <p class="intro">I grew up in Las Vegas, a city known for its energy and constant activity. However, my
            childhood was focused more on my own personal interests rather than the flashy side of the city. After
            finishing high school, I moved to Reno to attend college, where I spent several years focusing on my
            education and laying the groundwork for my career. Those years in Reno played a key role in shaping who I am
            today.
        </p>
        <p>A little over four years ago, my husband and I made the decision to start fresh in Denver, Colorado. The move
            brought new surroundings and opportunities, and we've come to truly appreciate our life here. While I’m not
            someone who spends a lot of time outdoors, the peaceful environment offers a refreshing contrast to my
            earlier experiences in Nevada. </p>
        <p>My professional journey has always been rooted in technology, with over five years of experience in IT
            support and helpdesk roles. This technical background sparked my interest in continuing my education,
            leading me to pursue a second Bachelor's degree in Software Development. I enjoy the process of learning new
            programming languages and applying them to solve real-world problems, and I'm excited to keep building on
            those skills.</p>
        <p>At home, my focus is on family and our pets. My husband and I share our space with <span
                class="sentence">four cats, a gecko, and a snake,</span> each of them bringing their own unique
            personality to our lives. Though I haven’t had as much time for reading lately, I cherish quiet moments and
            enjoy working toward goals that align with my passions and future aspirations.</p>
