    <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

    <p>As the blizzard <span id="firstVariable">______</span> outside, three friends, Mark, Mia, and Sam, found
        themselves trapped in a cozy cabin deep in the woods. The wind howled violently, and the snowflakes swirled
        around the cabin, reducing visibility to almost nothing. Inside, the air was warm, and a soft crackle from the
        fireplace added to the cozy atmosphere. The group had initially planned for a quick weekend getaway, but now
        they were stuck together and making the most of their time. With nothing but the eerie sound of the storm
        outside, they turned to their board games for salvation.</p>
    <p>"Let’s play something <span id="secondVariable">______</span>!" Sam suggested with a wide grin, her eyes
        gleaming with excitement. She was always the one to push for something spontaneous. "I’m bored of just staring
        at the snow, and we could really use a good laugh!"</p>
    <p>Mia grabbed the <span id="thirdVariable">______</span> box from the shelf, but Mark immediately protested,
        "That takes too long! Plus, I always lose!"</p>
    <p>After a brief back-and-forth, they decided on something much simpler: “Guess Who?” Each friend picked a
        character. Sam was in a playful mood, so she pretended to be a cat, complete with exaggerated purring sounds and
        little meows. Mark, not one to shy away from a challenge, chose to be a <span id="fourthVariable">______</span>,
        complete with a gruff voice and dramatic gestures. They took turns asking each other questions about their
        characters, making silly guesses and laughing uncontrollably at how ridiculous they looked. Sam even tried to
        climb up on the couch like a cat, prompting Mark to threaten to walk the plank.</p>
    <p>The game was a blast, and before they knew it, hours had passed. They’d forgotten all about the storm outside,
        lost in the simple joy of the game. Suddenly, the lights flickered back on, their brightness casting a warm glow
        across the room. But they didn’t care. The storm could rage as much as it wanted; they were too busy giggling at
        their silly game and enjoying the rare moment of peaceful fun together.</p>
