    <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScript - Part 1</h1>

    <p>As the blizzard <span id="firstVariable">______</span> outside, three friends, Mark, Mia, and Sam, found
        themselves trapped in a cozy cabin. With nothing but the howling wind and endless snowflakes outside, they turned to their board games for salvation.</p>
    <p>"Let’s play something <span id="secondVariable">______</span>!" Sam suggested, eyes gleaming. </p>
    <p>Mia grabbed the <span id="thirdVariable">______</span> box, but Mark protested, "That takes too long!" </p>
    <p>Finally, they decided to play “Guess Who?” Each friend picked a character.
        Sam pretended to be a cat while Mark was a <span id="fourthVariable">______</span>. They laughed so hard they
        forgot about the storm outside. Suddenly the lights flickered back on, but they didn’t care. They were too busy giggling at their silly game!
